AS A Traveler in the Bay Area
I WANT to see locations of transit businesses
SO THAT I can find where I need to go

GIVEN a website with transit information
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with the location of the transit business within the city
WHEN I view the location of the transit business
THEN I am shown the distance between it and my destination
